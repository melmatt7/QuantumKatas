# Welcome!

This kata continues the exploration of the Grover's search algorithm started in the [Grover's Algorithm kata](./../GroversAlgorithm/). It teaches of using Grovers Algorthm to solve Cryptarthims. 

You can [run the SolveCryptarthimsWithGrover kata as a Jupyter Notebook]()!

It is strongly recommended to complete the [Grover's Algorithm kata](./../GroversAlgorithm/) before proceeding to this one. You can also refer to its [README.md](./../GroversAlgorithm/README.md) for the list of resources on Grover's algorithm.
